## Usage

To use the app go to: [DrawBowls](https://annabuller.github.io/app-draw-bowls/).

After drawing three terms search each of them in the Internet and read its definition on your favourite website (ex. MDN or W3C).

It is recommended to draw **only three terms per day**. This will prevent you from waisting too much time for theory.

## App development

This app will be developed and extended along with the skills of the author.
